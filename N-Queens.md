- Where can a queen move?
  - A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A queen can move any number of steps in any direction. The only constraint is that it can’t change its direction while it’s moving. 
- Can a queen be in the same row or column?
  - No two queens can be in the same row or column. That allows us to place only one queen in each row and each column.  
- How can we check if we've reached the end?
  - If row == N, we've filled in all our rows successfully which implies the current board state is a valid combination

Run through a set of example cases:

```markdown
Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]

* How can N queens be placed on an NxN chessboard so that no two of them attack each other? Backtracking can be used since we start with one pos­si­ble move out of many avail­able moves. The three general steps include: the general steps of backtracking are: start with a sub-solution
check if this sub-solution will lead to the solution or not. If not, then come back and change the sub-solution and continue again.

The way we try to solve this is by placing a queen at a position and trying to rule out the possibility of it being under attack. We place one queen in each row/column. If we see that the queen is under attack at its chosen position, we try the next position. If a queen is under attack at all the positions in a row, we backtrack and change the position of the queen placed prior to the current position. We repeat this process of placing a queen and backtracking until all the N queens are placed successfully.



## 3: P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**General Idea:** Try a promising Queen position, see how it goes. If it fails, undo that Queen and try again somewhere else.

```markdown
Check if we've reached the end:
If row == N, we've filled in all our rows successfully which implies the current board state is a valid combination. Let's add it to our output list.
Loop through each column in the current row.
3. If we can't add a Queen at this position, skip this col value.
If we can, add a Queen at this position and adjust our bitmasks respectively.
Continue to the next row (call backtrack for row+1).
Undo our changes so we can try other col values.
```

**⚠️ Common Mistakes**

* What are some common pitfalls students might have when implementing this solution?

* For an 8×8 board, we have to choose positions for 8 identical queens from 64  different squares, which can be done in 64C8 = 4426165368 ways. You can tighten this up by enforcing one queen in each row through the use of 8 nested loop. Using such nested loops, we would only have to look at 44=256 configurations for a 4×4 board and 88 configurations for an 8×8 board --- that's still far too many. 

* Pay attention to the last inserted value. It can conflict with previous rows if the column difference is 0 (the Queens are on the same column line) or if column difference = row difference (Queens are on one diagonal)

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.


Given n as the number of queens (which is the same as the width and height of the board),

* **Time Complexity**: O(n!), because we are selecting if we can put or not put a Queen at that place
* **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), extra memory used includes the 3 sets used to store board state, as well as the recursion call stack
