## 1: U-nderstand
 
> **Understand** what the interviewer is asking for by using test cases and questions about the problem.
> 
> - Established a set (2-3) of test cases to verify their own solution later.
> - Established a set (1-2) of edge cases to verify their solution handles complexities.
> - Have fully understood the problem and have no clarifying questions.
> - Have you verified any Time/Space Constraints for this problem?

HAPPY CASE



EDGE CASE

```   
    
## 2: M-atch

> **Match** what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming, and strategies or patterns in those categories.

- Multiple passes: To find the length, or save other information about the contents
- Two pointers: ‘Race car’ strategy with one regular pointer, and one fast pointer
- Dummy node: Helpful for preventing errors when returning ‘head’ if merging lists, deleting from lists

## 3: P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**General Idea:** 

```markdown

```

⚠️ **Common Mistakes**

* 
## 4: I-mplement

> **Implement** the code to solve the algorithm.

```python

```
```java

```
    
## 5: R-eview

> **Review** the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.

- Trace through your code with an input to check for the expected output
- Catch possible edge cases and off-by-one errors

## 6: E-valuate

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.
