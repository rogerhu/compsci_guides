## 1: U-nderstand
 
> **Understand** what the interviewer is asking for by using test cases and questions about the problem.
> 
> - Established a set (2-3) of test cases to verify their own solution later.
> - Established a set (1-2) of edge cases to verify their solution handles complexities.
> - Have fully understood the problem and have no clarifying questions.
> - Have you verified any Time/Space Constraints for this problem?

- Can the input grid be blank??
    - Let’s assume the grid is not blank. We don’t need to consider empty inputs.
- Can the row size be different from the column size?
    - Yes, the row size can be different from the column size.
- What are the time and space constraints?
    - Time complexity should be `O(m*n)`, m being the rows of the matrix and n being the columns of matrix. Space complexity should be `O(m*n)` too.

HAPPY CASE

## 2: M-atch

> **Match** what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming, and strategies or patterns in those categories.

For 2D-Array, common solution patterns include:

- Perform a BFS/DFS Search through the 2D Array
    - A search through the 2D Array (either BFS or DFS) does not help us. We are transposing, not searching.
- Hash the 2D Array in some way to help with the Strings
    - Hashing would not help us transpose this array
- Create/Utilize a Trie
    - A Trie would not help us much in this problem since we are not trying to determine anything about a sequence of characters.

## 3: P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**Solution 1:**

**General Idea:** Use a zip function to gather all the first elements together and form a group, and so forth. i.e. [1, 2, 3] and [10, 20, 30] and returns (1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30)

```markdown
Use zip function on the unpacked matrix array, to gather the first elements together and form a group and so forth. 
```

**Solution 2:**

**General Idea:** Use list comprehension to access the column, to gather elements in row by column

```markdown
Use list comprehension to access the column, to gather elements in row by column
```

**Solution 3:**

**General Idea:** Create row from each column and fill each row with each column

```markdown
1) Create empty array
2) Create row for each column
3) Get each element from same column and insert into row
4) Return result
```

⚠️ **Common Mistakes**
* Not every 2D-Array problem follows the common techniques.

## 4: I-mplement

> **Implement** the code to solve the algorithm.

**Solution 1:**

```python
class Solution:
    def transpose(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Use zip function on the unpacked matrix array, to gather the first elements together and form a group and so forth. 
        return zip(*matrix)
```

**Solution 2:**

```python
class Solution:
    def transpose(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Use list comprehesion to access the column, to gather elements in row by column
        return [[matrix[i][j] for i in range(len(matrix))] for j in range(len(matrix[0]))]
```

**Solution 3:**

```python
class Solution:
    def transpose(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Create empty array
        result = []
        # Create row for each column
        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
            result.append([])
            # Get each element from same column and insert into row
            for i in range(len(matrix)):
                result[j].append(matrix[i][j])
        # Return result
        return result
```
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] transpose(int[][] A) {
		//Create empty array
		int M = A.length; int N = A[0].length;
		int[][] B = new int[N][M];

		// Create row for each column
		for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
				// Get each element from same column and insert into row
				B[j][i] = A[i][j];
			}
		}
		// Return result
		return B;
	}
}
```


## 5: R-eview

> **Review** the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.

- Trace through your code with an input to check for the expected output
- Catch possible edge cases and off-by-one errors

## 6: E-valuate

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.

Assume `N` represents the number of rows in 2D-array.
Assume `M` represents the number of columns in 2D-array.

**All 3 solutions results in the same space and time complexity**

* **Time Complexity**: O(N * M) we need to view each item in the 2D-Array
* **Space Complexity**: O(N * M), because we need space to hold the resulting matrix
