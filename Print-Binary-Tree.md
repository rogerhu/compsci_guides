- Can the input tree be Null?
    - Yes, the input could be Null. In that case, we do not print anything, since there are no leaf nodes.
- Could the tree possibly have no leaf nodes?
    - Unless the tree is Null, there have to be leaf nodes. Even the root can be a leaf node if it has no children.

For Trees, some things we should consider are:
- Some type of Tree Traversal: Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order, Level-Order
    - Choosing a specific Tree Traversal can help us in this problem identify leaf nodes from left to right.
- Store nodes within a HashMap to refer to later
    - We don’t need to refer to earlier nodes in the tree, so a HashMap would not help us as much in this context.
- Using Binary Search to find an element
    - We are not working with a binary search tree here.
- Applying a level-order traversal with a queue
    - This type of tree traversal does not help because we do not want to look at the tree layer by layer.
## 3: P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**General Idea:** Pre-Order Traversal of the Tree. At every node, verify if the node is a leaf or not. If so, print the value and continue.

```markdown
1) Basecase: If the current node is Null, return
2) Recursive: Get all nodes with no children
  a) If the current node has no children, print its value
  b) Recurse Left and Recurse Right
```

**⚠️ Common Mistakes**

* Remember to identify the basecase first. 

## 4: I-mplement

> **Implement** the code to solve the algorithm.

```python
def print_leaf_nodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
    # Basecase: If the current node is Null, return
    if not root:
        return
    
    # If the current node has no children, print its value
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        print(root.val, end = " ")
        
    # Recurse Left and Recurse Right
    self.print_leaf_nodes(root.left)
    self.print_leaf_nodes(root.right)
```
## 5: R-eview

> **Review** the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.

- Trace through your code with an input to check for the expected output
- Catch possible edge cases and off-by-one errors

## 6: E-valuate

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.

Assume `N` represents the number of nodes in the in the binary tree. `H` represents the height of the binary tree

* **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` because we will need to access each node in the binary tree.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(H)` because we only need space to hold the recursive stack, which is dependent on the height of the binary tree.
