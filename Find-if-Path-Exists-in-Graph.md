## 2: M-atch

> **Match** what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming, and strategies or patterns in those categories.

For Graph Problems, common solution patterns include:

- DFS/BFS: We could use either BFS or DFS. DFS is fewer lines of code, but BFS makes use of the adjacency dictionary data structure.
- Adjacency List: We already have an adjacency list, let's make it a adjacency dictionary.
- Adjacency Matrix: We can use an adjacency matrix to store the graph, but this will make the problem more complicated.
- Topological Sort: In order to have a topological sorting, the graph must not contain any cycles. We cannot apply this sort to this problem because we can have cycles in our graph.
- Union Find: Are there find and union operations here? Can you perform a find operation where you can determine which subset a particular element is in? This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset. Can you perform a union operation where you join two subsets into a single subset? Can you check if the two subsets belong to same set? If no, then we cannot perform union. 

## 3: P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

***Approach #1 DFS:***

**General Idea:** Let's run a DFS from the source vertex, if we encounter the destination vertex, then we found it. 

```markdown
1. Create an adjacency dictionary to hold the graph, vertex to edges
2. Create a DFS call to visit neighboring vertex
    a. Do not continue DFS if vertex was visited or destination was visited
    b. Add current vertex to visited set to not revisit visited vertex(avoid infinite loop)
    c. Visit vertex neighbors
4. Create a visited set to not revisit visited vertex
5. Call the DFS call on the source vertex
6. Return whether or not we have visited the destination vertex
```

***Approach #2 BFS:***

```markdown
1. Create an adjacency dictionary to hold the graph, vertex to edges
2. Create a visited set to not revisit visited vertex
3. BFS call to visit neighboring vertex
    a. If vertex was visited, then try the next vertex in queue
    b. We have a matching vertex to destination, return True
    c. Add vertex to vistied set to not revisit visited vertex(avoid infinite loop)
    d. Add neighbors to queue.
6. We have not visited destination vertex, return False
```

⚠️ **Common Mistakes**

* A adjacency dictionary is very important for us to traverse the graph.

## 5: R-eview

> **Review** the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.

- Trace through your code with an input to check for the expected output
- Catch possible edge cases and off-by-one errors

## 6: E-valuate

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.

Assume `V` represents the number of vertices/nodes.
Assume `E` represents the number of edges

***Approach #1 DFS & #2 BFS Share the same time and space complexity:***

* **Time Complexity**: O(V+E) We may need to visit each vertex/nodes and their edges.
* **Space Complexity**: O(V+E) accounting for the use of a adjacency dictionary.
