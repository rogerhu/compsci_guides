- When does a given path given priority over another?
  - In a basic Dijkstra algorithm, the only basis upon which one path is given priority over another is the cost. In this problem however, there is an additional constraint; length of route or (number of stops).
    
- What do we need to keep track of during the traversal?
  - We need to keep track of all routes to the node and compare on the basis of (cost and number of stops).

## 2: M-atch

> **Match** what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming, and strategies or patterns in those categories.
    
    For graph problems, some things we want to consider are:
    
- Dijkstra's: We can use Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm to find minimum path from single source with edge weights. The main trick to this problem is we have two constraints to consider in our Dijkstra's implementation. The priority queue must sort by stops and then by cost. We must sort by stops before cost. The issue arises when we find a less cost, but greater stop number path to an intermediary node. From `node0` -> `node1`, we can take `path 0->1`, with 5 cost and 1 stop, or we could take `0->3->1`, with 4 cost and 2 stops. If we update our Dijkstra's shortest path cache to be 4 cost, then we will miss out on a better cost because k = 2 already by taking the shortest path to 1. By taking the shortest cost path to 1 (0->3->1), we already used our 2 stops, so our next node must be our goal of `node2` to not violate `k` constraint. The actual shortest path is `0->1->4->2` where we take a higher cost path to 1, `0->1` cost 5, but `k = 1`.
- Adjacency List: We can use an adjacency list to store the graph, especially when the graph is sparse.
- Adjacency Matrix: We can use an adjacency matrix to store the graph, but a sparse graph will cause an unneeded worst-case runtime.
- Topological Sort: We can use topological sort when a directed graph is used and returns an array of the nodes where each node appears before all the nodes it points to. In order to have a topological sorting, the graph must not contain any cycles.
- Map: We can use a map to store the edges in the graph to lookup equations by name, and store all neighbors by name.
- Union Find: Are there find and union operations here? Can you perform a find operation where you can determine which subset a particular element is in? This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset. Can you perform a union operation where you join two subsets into a single subset? Can you check if the two subsets belong to same set? If no, then we cannot perform union.

**General idea:** Need to keep track of the number of stops taken to reach a node (city), in addition to the shortest path from the source node

```markdown
To implement Dijkstra, we need a priority queue to pop out the lowest weight node for next search. 

In this case, the weight would be the accumulated flight cost.

The node takes a form of¬†`(cost, src, k)`.¬†`cost`¬†is the accumulated cost,¬†`src`¬†is the current node's location,¬†`k`¬†is stop times we left as we only have at most K stops. I also convert¬†`edges`¬†to an adjacent list based graph¬†`g`.
    
Use a¬†`vis`¬†array to maintain visited nodes to avoid loop.¬†`
vis[x]`¬†record the remaining steps to reach x with the lowest cost. 
If¬†`vis[x] >= k`, then no need to visit that case¬†`(start from x with k steps left)`¬†as a better solution has been visited before (more remaining step and lower cost as heappopped beforehand). 

And we should initialize¬†`vis[x]`¬†to¬†`0`¬†to ensure visit always stop at a negative¬†`k`.
    
Once¬†`k`¬†is used up (`k == 0`) or¬†`vis[x] >= k`, we no longer push that node¬†`x`¬†to our queue. 
Once a popped cost is our destination, we get our lowest valid cost.
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes**

* The current state is being checked against previous state + cost. A common mistake is to check `prev[v]` against `prev[u] + cost(u,v)`. However, in this case we will not get the minimum value of the current state. It's possible that `curr_1 < curr_2 < prev` but, `curr_2` is encountered later than `curr_1`, resulting in it being overwritten.
