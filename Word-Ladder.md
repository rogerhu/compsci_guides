1. **U-nderstand**

- What are the possible characters in the words?
All lowercase alphabet letters.

- Do all words have the same number of characters?
Yes, all words have the same number of characters.

- Could the beginning or end word be empty?
No, each word must have at least one character.

- Could the beginning word be the same as the ending word?
No, the beginning and ending word will always be different.
    
    ```
    HAPPY CASE
    Input:
       beginWord = "hit"
       endWord   = "cog"
       wordList  = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
    
    Output: 5
    
    EDGE CASE
    Input:
       beginWord = "hit"
       endWord   = "cog"
       wordList  = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
    
    Output: 0
    ```
    
2. M-atch
    
    For graphs, some of the top things we want to consider are:
    
    - We can use BFS to traverse the graph, which works well for finding optimal path in unweighted graphs.
    - We can use DFS to traverse the graph, but will be less efficient at finding optimal path compared to BFS.
    - We can use an adjacency list to store graph, which works well for our sparse graph.
    - We can use an adjacency matrix to store graph, but will cause runtime slowdowns of O(N^2) for a sparse graph.
    - We can use topological sort to traverse the graph, but will share similar limitations like DFS.
3. P-lan
    
    Traverse the wordList using BFS, starting from beginWord until we either reach the end or see endWord. As we visit each node, we add all adjacent nodes by looking up if a certain word exists in wordList.
    

```markdown
    1) Create a set of all words in wordList, including endWord.
    2) Create a set of visited nodes
    3) Start BFS from beginWord, setting currentWord
       a) If currentWord is equal to endWord, return number of steps
       b) For each index of currentWord and each letter not equal to currentWord at index
          i)   Create candidateWord equal to currentWord
          ii)  Change candidateWord at current index to new letter
          iii) If it exists and not visited, traverse
    4) If endWord was not found, return 0
    
    Time Complexity: O(N*M^2)
    Space Complexity: O(N*M)
    
```

    **Common Mistakes**
    
    - Some people may attempt to find adjacent pairs of words by computing finding the number of different letters between each word, whose runtime is O(M^2). Instead, the difference can be computed via iteration over the possible letters to allow a O(M*26) runtime.

    ```java
    // Java Code
    private static final char[] letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".toCharArray();
    
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
      HashSet<String> wordsSet = new HashSet(wordList);
      HashSet<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
      Queue<Pair<String, Integer>> queue = new LinkedList();
      queue.offer(new Pair<>(beginWord, 1));
      while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
       Pair<String, Integer> pair = queue.poll();
       String word = pair.getKey();
       int length = pair.getValue();
       if (word.equals(endWord)) {
          return length;
       }
       for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j < letters.length; j++) {
             if (word.charAt(i) != letters[j]) {
                String candidate = word.substring(0,i) + letters[j] + word.substring(i+1);
                if (wordsSet.contains(candidate) && !visited.contains(candidate)) {
                   queue.offer(new Pair<>(candidate, length + 1));
                   visited.add(candidate);
                }
             }
          }
       }
      }
      return 0;

    ```python
    # Python Code
    LETTERS = set('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
    
    def word_ladder(start, end, words):
        words = set(words)
        visited = set()
        queue = [(start, 1)] # queue for BFS, which stores the word and distance
    
        while len(queue) > 0:
            word, length = queue.pop(0)
            if word == end:
                return length
            for i, char in enumerate(word):
                for letter in LETTERS:
                    if char != letter:
                        candidate = word[:i] + letter + word[i + 1:]
                        if candidate in words and candidate not in visited:
                            queue.append([candidate, length + 1])
                            visited.add(candidate)
        return 0
