## 2: M-atch

> **Match** what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming, and strategies or patterns in those categories.

- Stack: What could we push onto a stack to make this problem easier? Stacks don’t allow us to keep track of data based on keys.
- Queue: Queues fall into the same category as Stacks, do we need to maintain any sense of ordering to solve this problem?
- HashMap: HashMaps allow us to store data for quick access. What could we store in a HashMap to make this problem easier?
- Heap: Do we need some sort of ordering to our data that a Heap could provide?

## 3: P-lan

⚠️ **Common Mistakes**

* 

## 4: I-mplement

> **Implement** the code to solve the algorithm.

```python

```
```java

```
    
## 5: R-eview

> **Review** the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.

- Trace through your code with an input to check for the expected output
- Catch possible edge cases and off-by-one errors

## 6: E-valuate

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.
