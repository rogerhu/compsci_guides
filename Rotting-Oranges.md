1. **U-nderstand**
    1. What do the possible values of the grid represent? 
    
    1’s are fresh oranges, 2’s are rotten oranges and 0’s are empty spaces
    
    b. What data structures can I use to store the grids?
    
    You can use a 2D array, hashset, queue, etc.
    
    c. Do we need to keep track of the level?
    
    Yes, you can keep track of the level using a search algorithm. Trick is to only increment once per level and only if fresh.
    
    d. What is a possible edge case?
    
    That there is no fresh, there is no rotten
    
    ```markdown
    HAPPY CASE
    Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
    Output: 4
    
    Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
    Output: -1
    
    EDGE CASE
    Input: grid = [[0,2]]
    Output: 0
    ```
    
2. M-atch
    
    We can model the grid in the form of a graph and to compute the distance for every node, we can apply standard BFS algorithm using a queue. We can think of it in a level by level manner. The key observation is that fresh oranges adjacent to rotten oranges are rotten on day 1, those adjacent to those oranges are rotten on day 2, and so on. The phenomenon is similar to a level order traversal on a graph, where all the initial rotten oranges act as root nodes.
    
    We can just push all these root nodes into a queue and perform BFS on a grid algorithm, to calculate the total time taken to rot all the oranges. Since there can be multiple rotten cells, we will push all those cells in the queue first and then continue with the BFS. If all oranges are not rotten before our algorithm terminates, we will return -1. 
    
3. P-lan
    
    General Description of plan (1-2 sentences)
    
    1. Initialize a queue for breadth first search.
    2. Iterate over the entire grid and add all the rotten oranges in the queue and also keep counting the number of fresh oranges.
    3. If the number of fresh oranges is zero then we can directly return zero.
    4. Otherwise, traverse the queue in level order fashion and add all the adjacent fresh oranges in the queue and decrement the count of fresh oranges by 1 each time. When we add a fresh orange in the queue, we mark it as rotten so that it is not added multiple times.
    5. If after one complete traversal of a level, the queue is not empty, then increase the minutes by one.
    6. Repeat this process until we have no more rotten oranges.
    7. If the number of fresh oranges after the entire process is still not zero, then return -1 indicating that it’s impossible to rot all the oranges.
    8. Else return the time required to rot all the oranges.

5. R-eview
    
    Verify the code works for the happy and edge cases you created in the “Understand” section
    
6. E-valuate
    - Time Complexity: O(n*m), where n — number of rows m– number of cols, for first traversal of the grid to find all the rotten and fresh oranges + O(n*m) for queue traversal if there is only one fresh orange and that too when the last orange is fresh.
    - Space Complexity: O(n*m), where n — number of rows m– number of cols, extra space for queue in the worst case when all the oranges are rotten.
