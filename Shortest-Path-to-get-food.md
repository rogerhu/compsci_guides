1. **U-nderstand**

- Does this problem give us a starting point?
This problem doesn't provide you a start point. We, then, need to find it by iterating over the grid to find the cell which value is `*`. The problem guarantee that there is only one `*`.
    
- What is the worst case scenario? 
We should visit each cell in the grid is the worst case scenario. Therefore, the time complexity is¬†`O(mn)` where m, n is the row and column size of grid.
    
- When we find the food, what do we return?
Until we find the food, return the level.

    HAPPY CASE
    Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","O","O","X"],["X","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X"]]
    Output: 3
    
    Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","#","X"],["X","X","X","X","X"]]
    Output: -1
    
    Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","X","O","#","O","X"],["X","O","O","X","O","O","X","X"],["X","O","O","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"]]
    Output: 6
    ```
    
2. M-atch
    
    For graph problems, some things we want to consider are:
    
    - The use of BFS can help us keep track of what cells are already visited. Once a cell is visited mark it with `X`, so that during BFS when we see a cell with `X`, it is either obstacle or is already visited, so we can skip it.
3. P-lan
    
    General Description of plan (1-2 sentences)
    
    - First, we need to find where to start.
    - Starting BFS with the help of deque¬†`(i, j, cnt)`, explore 4 neighbors and increment¬†`cnt`¬†by 1
    - Mark visited point as¬†`X`¬†to avoid revisit
    - If¬†`#`¬†is met, return¬†`cnt`

2. R-eview
    
    Verify the code works for the happy and edge cases you created in the ‚ÄúUnderstand‚Äù section
    
3. E-valuate
    - Time Complexity: O(NM), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns. We had to traverse the whole grid.
    - Space Complexity: O(NM), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns. We needed a visited array to keep track of the visited cells in the grid.
