## Introduction

Graphs are one of the most prevalent data structures in computer science. It's a powerful data structure that's utilized to represent relationships between different types of data. In a graph, each data point is stored as a **node** and each relationship between those data points is represented by an **edge**. For example, a social network is considered a graph in which each person is considered a node and a friendship between two people is considered an edge.

Graphs are best utilized for problems in which there are binary relationships between objects. Once a problem can be represented as a graph, the problem can generally be solved based off of one of the key graph algorithms. For interviews, it is vital to know how to implement a graph, basic graph traversals (BFS, DFS) and how to sort topologically the graph.

## Graph Terminology
### Graph components
Graphs consist of a set of..
* **vertices**, which are also referred to as nodes
    * Nodes that are directly connected by an edge are commonly referred to as **neighbors**.
* **edges**, connections between pairs of vertices

### Graph types

#### Directed & undirected graphs
A **directed** graph is a graph that in which all edges are associated with a direction. An example of a directed edge would be a one way street.

An **undirected** graph is a graph in which all edges do not have a direction. An example of this would be a friendship!

#### Cyclic & acyclic graphs
Before going over the what cyclic and acyclic graphs are, there are two key terms to cover: **path** and **cycle**. A **path** is a sequence of vertices connected by edges and a **cycle**  a path whose first and last vertices are the same.

A **cyclic** graph means that there contains a least one cycle within the graph.

An **acyclic** graph has no cycles within it.

A commonly used phrase when referring to graphs is a **directed acylic graph (DAG)**, which is a directed graph in which there are *no* cycles. In a DAG, these two terms are commonly used to denote nodes with special properties:
* **Sink** nodes have no outgoing edges, only incoming edges
* **Source** nodes only have outgoing edges, no incoming edges

## Graph representations
### Adjacency lists
**Adjacency list** is the most common way to represent graphs. With this approach of representing a graph, each node stores a list of its adjacent vertices. For undirected graphs, each edge from _u_ to _v_ would be stored twice: once in _u_'s list of neighbors and once in _v_'s list of neighbors.

### Edge sets/ lists
An **edge set** simply represents a graph as a collection of all its edges.

### Adjacency matrix
An **adjacency matrix** represents a graph with _n_ nodes as a _n_ by _n_ boolean matrix, in which matrix[_u_][_v_] is set to true if an edge exists from node _u_ to node _v_.

The representation of a graph is efficient for checking if an edge exists between a pair of vertices. However, it may be less efficient for search algorithms because it requires iterating through all the nodes in the graph to identify a node's neighbors.

### Runtime Analysis
Below is a chart of the most common graph operations and their runtimes for each of the graph representations. In the chart below, _V_ represents the number of verticies in the graph and _E_ represents the number of edges in the graph.

|  Representation       | Getting all adjacent edges for a vertex| Traversing entire graph | hasEdge(u, v) | Space    |
| --------              | -------- | --------                | --------      | -------- |
| **Adjacency matrix**  | O(V)     | O(V<sup>2</sup>)        | O(1)          | O(V<sup>2</sup>)|
| **Edge Set**          | O(E)     | O(E)                    | O(E)          | O(E)
| **Adjacency List**    | O(1)     | O(V + E)                | O(max number of edges a vertex has)  | O(E + V)
