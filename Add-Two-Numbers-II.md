- Can either input list be empty?
  - No. Each list will have anywhere from 1 to 100 nodes
- Will the node values be valid
  - Yes. The node values will be between 0 and 9
- Can the list represent a number that has leading zeroes?
  - No. The lists will not represent a number with leading zeroes.
- Can I reverse the input list and solve like Add Two Numbers?
    - No. You may not reverse the input list.
- What is the runtime and space complexity?
    - The runtime is constant O(n) and space is O(1) not counting memory stack.

> **Match** what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming, and strategies or patterns in those categories.

For Linked Lists problems, we want to consider the following approaches:

- Multiple passes over the linked list. If we were able to take multiple passes of the linked list, would that help solve the problem?
  - Do we need to discover the length of the lists? This might be useful.
- Dummy Head. Would using a dummy head as a starting point help simplify our code and handle edge cases?
  - Are we restructuring the given lists? Creating a new one? This could be helpful in keeping track of our return list.
- Two Pointers. If we used two pointers to iterate through list, would that help us solve this problem?
  - Two pointers are used in the sense that we are traversing two separate lists. Multiple pointers for one list does not make sense here though because we are not trying to compare nodes in the list with other nodes in that same list.

## 3: P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**General Idea:** Obtain the length of both linked list. Recursively iterate through both lists and sum the values of the nodes and remainder from the previous addition for each node of equal length. 

```markdown
1) Get the length of the linked lists
2) Add the linked lists recursively
    a) Basecase: End of List -> Return None and carry value of 0
    b) Get Current Sum and Current Carry Value to recursively pass back to calling function
        i) Get Current Sum  by adding value at l1, l2, and carry value.
            1. If len1 > len2, then recursively call l1.next, to get next head node and carry value, as this signifies adding l1 value and 0
            2. If len2 > len1, then recursively call l2.next, to get next head node and carry value, as this signifies adding l2 value and 0
            3. If len1 == len2, then recursively call l1.next and l2.next, to get next head node and carry value, as this signifies adding both values
        ii) Get Current Carry Value by floor divide Current Sum
        iii) Get Current Sum Digit by module Current Sum
    c) Return Current Node with Current Sum Digit as value and previous head node as next node AND Current Carry Value
3) After recusive call, if there is carry over value, set as head node
4) Return the head node
```

**⚠️ Common Mistakes**

- Which of the above would provide us with an optimal solution?
    - First of all, the only way to add the numbers without reversing the linked list is to progress through the linked list recurively to use the memory stack as our reverse.
    - We will also need to go with multiple passes. Once we know the length of the linked list, we can adding digits that are in the same position. For example 456 + 23, we can skip 4 and add 56 and 23.

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.

Assume `N` represents the number of nodes in the linked list 1. `M` represents the number of nodes in the linked list 2. 

* **Time Complexity**: `O(N or M)` because we need to make N or M recursive calls to add the all digits. Constant Time. 
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` not counting the memory stack, because the maximum number of recursive calls we need to store in the memory stack is based on `O(N or M)`
