**Question:**
**Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[start1, end1], [start2,end2],...]` find the minimum number of conference rooms required.**

**WIP**

- start by trying to solve the problem without sorting
    - demonstrate why it becomes an increasingly complicated problem if the meeting rooms aren't sorted first
- write about how we should have started by writing out a couple of cases so we fully understand the problem
- briefly discuss how the problem could be optimized ithe meeting rooms were sorted
- discuss how the meeting rooms should be sorted. by start time? end time? duration?
- talk about the advantages of creating helper functions such as sortMeetingRoomsByStartTime()
- discuss how the problem can be thought of differently now that we have sorted meeting rooms
