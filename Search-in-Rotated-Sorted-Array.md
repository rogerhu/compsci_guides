> **Match** what this problem looks like to known categories of problems, e.g. Linked List or Dynamic Programming, and strategies or patterns in those categories.

For Array problems, we want to consider the following approaches:

- Sort. 
    - The range of possible numbers is semi-sorted, we can run binary search on the two halves. A full sort would exceed our runtime expectations.
- Two pointer solutions (left and right pointer variables). 
    - First we split the problem into two sorted arrays. Then we can use binary search on both sorted havles. 
- Storing the elements of the array in a HashMap or a Set. 
    - A HashMap or Set just complicates our code.
- Traversing the array with a sliding window. Similar to the two pointer solution. 
    - A sliding window doesn't really help us here.

## 3: P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**General Idea:** Let's split the array into two sorted arrays by finding the inflexion point using binary search. I.E. [[Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array]]. We can then run binary search on the two sorted arrays using binary search. I.E. [[Binary Search Problem]]


```markdown
1. Create a function to get the inflexion point, the minimum value in list. For more details see [[Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array]]
2. Create/Run binary search for target in left and right half. For more details see [[Binary Search Problem]]
3. Return the search results. The max function checks between a positive value(found index) vs negative value(not found index).
```

**⚠️ Common Mistakes**

* We want to ask for space/time complexity. Yes this is an easy problem if we had O(n) time. But the interviewer wants to solve this problem in O(logn) time.

## 5: R-eview

> **Review** the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.

- Trace through your code with an input to check for the expected output
- Catch possible edge cases and off-by-one errors

## 6: E-valuate

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.

Assume `N` represents the number of items in the array.

* **Time Complexity**: `O(logN)` because we can used binary search for the inflexion point, then binary search on both sorted halves. 
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` because we only need two pointers to do the job.
