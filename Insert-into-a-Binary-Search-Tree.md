- What is the type of tree we are working with?
  - The input will be a binary search tree
- Can I assume the tree will be complete?
  - No. A node may have less than 2 children
- Can I expect to receive an empty tree as input?
  - Yes, the input tree can have 0-10000 nodes
- Are the node values unique?
    - Yes, the node values are unique
- Is it guaranteed that the value to insert does not exist in the BST?
    - Yes, the node to insert does not originally exist in the BST

HAPPY CASE
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5]

Input: root = [40,20,60,10,30,50,70], val = 25
Output: [40,20,60,10,30,50,70,null,null,25]

EDGE CASE
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,null], val = 5
Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5]

If you are dealing with Binary Trees some common techniques you can employ to help you solve the problem:

- Think about appropriate Tree Traversal: Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order, Level-Order
    - Since we need to the value to insert with existing node values in both trees top down, a Pre-Order traversal would be appropriate
- Store nodes within a HashMap to refer to later
    - We don't need to access the nodes or their values after they have been processed, so this technique is not useful for this problem
- Using Binary Search to find an element
    - We are looking to find the correct position at which to insert the value in this problem so this technique is useful for this problem
- Applying a level-order traversal with a queue
    - Since we need to compare nodes and node values in both trees top down, a level-order traversal using a queue could be used but try solving the problem using Pre-Order first

## 3: P-lan

> **Plan** the solution with appropriate visualizations and pseudocode.

**General Idea:** Recursively traverse binary search trees for the correct position for the current value, by going left if a larger value is seen or going right if a smaller value is seen. 

```markdown
1) Base Case: Check if the tree is empty. If it is, return a new TreeNode with node value of val
2) Recursively traverse the tree in pre-order fashion
    a) Compare the input value with the node values
        i) If input value > node.val: traverse the left subtree
        ii) Else traverse the right subtree
3) Return the root of the tree
```

**⚠️ Common Mistakes**
- Not recognizing that the input is a binary search tree
    - Read the problem description carefully and clarify with your interviewer if you see this (or a different tree problem) in an interview
- Choosing the incorrect traversal type
    - Try to walk through the problem by hand and see the order in which you are processing the nodes. This will clue you into the type of traversal necessary
    - Suppose you chose level order traversal, where would you insert the node into the binary search tree?

## 4: I-mplement

> **Implement** the code to solve the algorithm.

```python
class Solution:
    def insertIntoBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Check if the tree is empty. If it is, return a new TreeNode with node value of val
        if not root:
            return TreeNode(val)
        
        # Recursively traverse the tree in pre-order fashion
        if root.val > val:
            # If node.val > input value: traverse the left subtree
            root.left = self.insertIntoBST(root.left, val)
        else:
            # Else traverse the right subtree
            root.right = self.insertIntoBST(root.right, val)
        
        # Return the root of the tree
        return root
```
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode insertIntoBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        // Check if the tree is empty. If it is, return a new TreeNode with node value of val
        if(root==null)
            return new TreeNode(val);
        
        // Recursively traverse the tree in pre-order fashion

        // If node.val > input value: traverse the left subtree
        if(root.val>val)
            root.left = insertIntoBST(root.left,val);
        // Else traverse the right subtree
        else
            root.right = insertIntoBST(root.right,val);

        // Return the root of the tree
        return root;
    }
}
```
    
## 5: R-eview

> **Review** the code by running specific example(s) and recording values (watchlist) of your code's variables along the way.

- Trace through your code with an input to check for the expected output
- Catch possible edge cases and off-by-one errors

## 6: E-valuate

> **Evaluate** the performance of your algorithm and state any strong/weak or future potential work.

Assume `H` represents the height of the binary search tree
    
* **Time Complexity**: O(H)
    *  We only need visit each node along the path of the binary search tree. 
* **Space Complexity**: O(H) 
    * O(H) using recursion, because O(H) for space is used for the recursion stack.
