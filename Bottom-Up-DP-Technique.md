# Bottom Up Dynamic Programming
In the [[Dynamic Programming]] Overview, we solved the "Hello World" of recursion problems, a function that found the `N`th [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in `O(N)` time complexity. The solution used recursion + memoization or Top Down DP, which also required `O(N)` extra space to solve the problem. Now we will use the Bottom Up DP technique to solve the same problem in order to achieve greater space efficiency.

## Finding the Bottom
Let's now take a look at the call graph for the recursive algorithm with repeat calls to the same function pointing to the same node. ![Fibonacci DAG](https://i.imgur.com/yThh6bR.png)

Here we see that `f(5)` depends on the same result from `f(3)` as `f(4)` does. By flattening this graph out as well, we can see that it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It is important that it is acyclic in the top down technique because if there was a cycle in the call graph the recursive algorithm would have required a cached answer for one that did not exist already and you would have blown your stack as you continuously evaluated the cycle.

In the bottom up technique, forming the DAG is essential because you need to understand where the other end of the call graph is or the bottom or the opposite end of the answer from a topologically sorted graph. In this case, that is `f(0)`. So a bottom up DP solution will start from `f(0)` and move to the right solving each Fibonacci number until we get to the answer. 

```python
class FibBottomUp(Fib):
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
    def f(self, n):
        c = self.cache
        c[0] = 0
        c[1] = 1
        self.work = 2
        for i in range(2,n+1):
            self.work += 1
            c[i] = c[i-1] + c[i-2]
        return c[n]
print(FibBottomUp().results(6))
```
`The 6th Fibonacci number is 8 and requires 7 computations`
In this solution we replaced the recursive call with an iterative call and rather than working from the desired number back to the dependencies, we start with the known dependencies and work up to the solution.

Because we are working up from the dependencies we can often spot when dependencies will no longer be necessary and use that information to reduce the space requirement of the algorithm.

```python
class FibNoCache(Fib):
    def f(self, n):
        if n < 2:
            return n
        self.work = 2
        pp = 0
        p = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            self.work += 1
            t = p + pp
            pp = p
            p = t
        return p
print(FibNoCache().results(6))
```
`The 6th Fibonacci number is 8 and requires 7 computations`

So now we've achieved the same computation time saving, i.e., going from `O(2**N)` brute-force to `O(N)`. Further, as is common with the bottom-up formulation, in this case we can find more storage saving by understanding how we are traversing the DAG. Since we are traversing from left to right and the dependency of any node is at most two nodes back we realize that we only need to store 2 values, `O(1)`, rather than retaining all `O(N)` previous numbers.
